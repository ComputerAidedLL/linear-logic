(* From Wikipedia:

Sokoban (倉庫番 sōkoban?, warehouse keeper) is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. The puzzle is usually implemented as a video game.

That is, given a freeform shape with some initial state, which contains the locations of
- clear spaces (immovable, player can go on top)
- one player (movable, must start on a clear space)
- walls (immovable, player cannot go on top)
- goals (immovable, player can go on top)
- boxes (movable but change location, so player cannot go on top)

The player must achieve the goal of getting each box on top of a goal, finishing with all boxes on unique goals simultaneously.

The player can push boxes in one of four directions onto clear spaces. *)


(* Here, we use linear logic to model the initial state, goal, objects, and allowable action. Then we solve one very easy level of Sokoban.

Some notes on this file:

- Why use linear logic? Because it models state. If you move forward, you consume the fact that you were on the previous space. etc.
  Although I mostly use the (**) connective and none of the fancier ones...
- The axioms here in Coq are classical; so, the player can use them as many times as she wants.
- Why do this? How's this different from writing a program in haskell? The novelty is that here, writing the rules is enough to enable you to play the game!

- Sokoban is PSPACE-complete, so proof search will be slow. (It's not implemented here.)
- Applying rules forward (often using cut) equates to pushing the blocks. 
- Applying them backward, in proof assistant style, equates to pulling the blocks.

Some optimizations:

- More automation, so a move rule really does a move and doesn't require the environment to be manipulated 5 times to apply it, then apply the next rule.
- Pretty-printing (level -> environment parser, as well as environment -> level printer). I implemented a bit of it in the style of Coq 2048.
- Sokoban only allows the player to push one box at a time. One could generalize this to chains of boxes in a line.
- One could write a checker for stuck states, which do exist. *)
